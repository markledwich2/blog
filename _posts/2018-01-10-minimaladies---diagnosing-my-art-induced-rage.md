Laura and I recently visited the Queensland Art Gallery and discovered a painting we both loved -*[Michael Zavros](http://www.michaelzavros.com/), Bad Dad*.

I thought it was about a parent with a party-hangover avoiding his children. But those who know better spot that it is also a throwback to *Caravaggio, Narcissus*.

<br>It is playful, skillful, aesthetic and works with meaning and associations at many levels. For me, you can’t get better than this, but you can get a lot worse. I feel sorry for Laura who endured my endless rants induced by some minimalist paintings.

Consider *Robert Rauschenberg, White Painting&nbsp;*in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art featured at the top of this post. There should be a name for the feeling of rage when you see what normal folks call modern art , and I feel it intensely. The museum tries to explain how you could find some sort of meaning in it

> .. White Paintings as airports for lights, shadows, and particles, establishing an enduring understanding of the series as receptive surfaces that respond to the world around them… if one were sensitive enough to the subtle changes on their surfaces one could tell what time it was and what the weather was like outside. Ultimately, the power of the White Paintings lies in the shifts in attention they require from the viewer, asking us to slow down, watch closely over time, and inspect their mute painted surfaces for subtle shifts in color, light, and texture.

This explanation also applies to the wall behind the painting. This reasoning seems like a rationalisation. I want to know the real reason why I am being assaulted with this spectacle of nothingness.

Maybe the curator for the New York Museum of Modern art will enlighten me

> It’s tempting to look at one of these paintings and think some jerk just took a tube of white paint and spread it on a canvas but it’s not actually that easy

> There a lot of subtle intricacies that make it more than just a white canvas

I reject both of these reasons to appreciate the creative skill outright. Relative to classical paintings, these do not require much skill to create. I mean, my splashes of paint probably wouldn’t be as good as Pollock, but even I could purchase white canvases.

> These artists [minimalists] began with these ideas a rejection of abstract expressionism

I think we are starting to get to the true reasons why art curators decide to exhibit these. By seeing it as a representation of a movement, or the identity of people who made it, infuses the painting with meaning that is not self evident. The vast majority of people will not be aware of the detailed historical context and not particularly care. It makes me wonder who the art curators are curating for.

Which brings me to the deep pathological elitism that is the real reason for this art. The narrator explains it perfectly without self-awareness:

> One of my favorite things about modern art is that rage that it seems to provoke in some people

At some level, the curators and cultural elitists love the fact that normal people get angry at it. Does it make them feel superior about having more sophisticated taste? I don’t like to project negative drives on them, but I don’t how else to interpret the schadenfreude described above. I think this is bad behaviour. Making fun of regular peoples reaction causes suffering and a cultural rift. Curators should think about their purpose given the gallery is publicly funded and intended to be used by the general public.
