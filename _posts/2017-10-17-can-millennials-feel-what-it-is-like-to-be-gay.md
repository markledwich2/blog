The classical scientific understanding of emotions describe them as discrete categories produced by a primitive parts of our brain similar to other animals. Strangely the word “lizard brain” stuck, even though technically lizards are not a common ancestor. New theories incorporate other parts of the brain with higher level of processing required for the conscious experience of emotion. One implication of the new accounts are that culture and language play a part in our experience of emotion.<br><br>Recent papers like&nbsp;[A higher-order theory of emotional consciousness](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/10/E2016.full)&nbsp; and&nbsp;[Solving the Emotion Paradox](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/baba/ac9a58e2c085932ab3035ec476e6457d5d82.pdf)&nbsp;describe what I think is a much more plausible account of emotion than anything else so far.&nbsp;

Lisa Barrett summarises her paper

> People believe that they know an emotion when they see it, and as a consequence assume that emotions are discrete events that can be recognized with some degree of accuracy, but scientists have yet to produce a set of clear and consistent criteria for indicating when an emotion is present and when it is not. I propose one solution to this paradox: People experience an emotion when they conceptualize an instance of affective feeling. In this view, the experience of emotion is an act of categorization, guided by embodied knowledge about emotion.

Feelings are higher-order information processing that include – but are not a direct experience of – the “lizard brain”. Lisa's take is that at an instance of time we have a "core affect" consisting of valence (good/bad) and arousal (need for a response) which is innate/existing at birth. Core affect seems to be a better match to objective observable measures (e.g. facial expressions, heart rate) than classical emotional categories. At a higher level, categorisation based on knowledge of emotion is attached to the affect which can be made available consciously and reflected upon. By attaching a higher level understanding to an emotion, it means that the feeling of it includes many possible “flavours” of emotion that have been learnt through experience.<br><br>If this is true, then understanding the emotion of others beyond core affect requires solid theory of mind and awareness of common social context. According to this, we can’t train autistic kids to categorize emotions of others with facial expressions. Our computers can’t be trained just from images, they need human level emotion intelligence (or an FRMI scan).

For me, learning and using the word “schadenfreude” allowed me to experience feeling pleasure in other people’s pain more vividly and connect with others who feel the same way. Labelling it also allows me to experience it more attentively and control my behaviour better. I can choose to stay and laugh in the blissful experience of schadenfreude ^_^. Or I can acknowledge that emotional state consciously and help the person who dropped their papers in a puddle. Just like with complex flavours, describing and identifying makes your taste of them more vivid and pleasurable. You also have practice tasting and reflecting to perceive the “detail” of them.

Which brings me to the feeling of “gay” that I baited you with. Do I lack the ability to have a vivid experience of light-hearted and carefree happiness that my grandparents once had? Are there other emotions that should be part of our regular language?

Rather than try to bring “gay” back, I leave you with the word “[vem&ouml;dalen](https://youtu.be/8ftDjebw8aA)” - the fear that everything has already been done.
