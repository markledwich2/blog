Have you ever considered there might be some serious metaphysical issues with the Star Trek transporter? I feel na&iuml;ve that I never considered – until now – that the above scene contains 5 people being disintegrated/murdered before new people are created in another place.

There are many people who are not comfortable with using this type of transport, and for good reason. Problems with transporters get to the core of our intuitions around identity. There are 5 levels of transporter understanding, 3 of which I am plagiarising from one of my favourite podcasts -&nbsp;[Very Bad Wizards](https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/)

### **1 - The na&iuml;ve realist stage**

A person disappears in one place, and re-appears exactly the same in another. It seems as if it is you, so there is no problem.

### **2 - The rational stage**

You are disintegrated. There is another person created in your place, but you are dead. The fact that there is someone else to take my place offers little comfort.

### **3 - Continuity of self is an illusion**

Our intuitive understanding of a continuous self is an illusion. We don't actually have continuity of consciousness or a material self. We are only conscious moment to moment, and in deep sleep and under states of anaesthesia we completely loose it.

One simple example should push your intuition into being comfortable with the transporter:

1. Before bed take a tablet that increases your metabolism to an extreme level
2. Go into a deep sleep
3. You wake up with completely new cells, but pretty much the same in every other way as when you went to bed

If you are comfortable with this, then you should be comfortable with the transporter.

### **4 - Self is an illusion**

Our intuitive understanding of being a self is an illusion. The phenomenon of "being someone" is a controlled hallucination created by your brain in the form of a particular type of information processing.&nbsp;

There are many parts of what is like to be a human self

* **bodily self**: being a body and of having a particular body.
* **perspectival self**: perceiving the world from a particular first-person point of view.
* **volitional self**: experiences of intention and of agency, of urges to do this or that, and of being the causes of things that happen.
* **narrative self**: experience of being a continuous and distinctive person over time, built from a rich set of autobiographical memories.
* **social self**: the social self is that aspect of self-experience that is refracted through the perceived minds of others, shaped by our unique social milieu.

Any of those aspects change over time, or be removed, and we still feel like our existence has continued. Once you break apart the intuitive self and the mechanisms of consciousness into the system it is, you discover that there is little difference or independence between what you consider self and the world around you. The desire to continue existence is just a deep human bias without any justification.

Once you understand this, you ought not mind if your current state of being is replaced by someone completely different at the other end. As long as the person is unique and with equal or more contribution of well-being to universe, then it is – from an impartial point of view – preferable.

In other words, you have become comfortable stepping into the transporter and would ask for someone better to take you place at the other end.

### **5 - Back to earth**

Only some extreme mediators (or people taking mushrooms/LSD) have been able to internalise the concept of not-self. When value and meaning coming from human psychology are abandoned as arbitrary, then there is no meaning left.&nbsp;

The folk understanding of self is a useful illusion to act in the parochial social context that we live in. At least until transporters, or metaphysical challenging technology exists and there is a need to navigate the new ethics.

You are comfortable with the transporter and concepts of not self but have not been able to internalise it. You choose to accept the intuitions of stage 1 unless in important contradiction with stage 4.
