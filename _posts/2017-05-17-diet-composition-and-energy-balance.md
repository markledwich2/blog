Summary of [Obesity Energetics: Body Weight Regulation and the Effects of Diet Composition](/uploads/hall2017.pdf).

**The calories in Fats and carbs have about the same effect on your weight**
<br>Effect on weight and energy expelled are about the same for high carb vs high fat diets. Based on 32 controlled feeding studies.

> Controlled feeding studies are used exclusively because people forget and lie about what they eat

**Calories in do not equal out**
<br>Energy intake and expenditure are interdependent variables that are dynamically influenced by each other and body weight. Attempts to alter energy balance through diet or exercise are countered by physiological adaptations that resist weight loss

## Energy Expenditure

**Thermic effect of food**
<br>Increase of metabolic rate observed for several hours following the ingestion of a meal

* Energy expended in higher in protein than in carbohydrates which is higher thanÂ  fat
* Only 10% of energy intake

**Resting energy expenditure**
<br>Energy expended when not performing physical work and is typically the largest contribution to daily energy expenditure

* obese have a higher absolute REE
* mass explains about 70% of REE differences (i.e. heavier people use more energy)
* possible that involves fluxes though various energy-requiring metabolic pathways

**Physical activity expenditure**
<br>All physical activity (not just going to gym)

* large amounts of exercise are required to result in a modest degree of average weight loss
* preferential loss of body fat and maintenance of fat-free mass compared to diet-induced weight loss
* exercise interventions typically result in less average weight loss than expected based on the exercise calories expended and individual weight changes are highly variable even when exercise is supervised to ensure adherence

## Macronutrients (Fat, Carbs, Protein)

Higher protein diets appear to offer advantages regarding energy expenditure and body composition

Relative effects of dietary carbohydrate and fat are minimal

## Adaptation to changes in energy intake

Eating behaviour is influenced by social and environmental influences, and molecular feedback mechanisms.

* Intake generally determined by habit, convenience or opportunity rather than need
* Hormones (such as leptin) with signals from body weight affect feeding behaviour

> investigating the control of energy intake requires obtaining accurate food intake measurements in free-living people over long time scales. This has not been done and is a major challenge
