			<p>If you have found yourself perversely linked to a questionable article on <a href="https://www.quillette.com">Quillette</a> recently, then you are not alone. Clair Lehmann started Quillette in 2015 from an Australian basement (a country known for overt racism). It wasn’t until 2017, when the sophomoric online magazine <a href="http://quillette.com/2017/08/07/google-memo-four-scientists-respond/">defended</a> the infamously sexist ‘Google Memo’ that it really took off with a unsavoury audience. The embattled founder recently boasted on twitter that Quillette reached over 600K people in May, surpassing fellow men’s magazine - Spiked. Quillette writers are a mix of journalists, academics and students who feel they have been outcast by academia and elite institutions for their heterodox views. They use their anger as motivation to make carefully nuanced and well-researched articles that are not easy to dismiss. The unique danger of Quillette is that it seduces men with the appeal of “rational” and “evidence based” articles which are often shared by conservative “intellectuals” like Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris. The intellectualism is a thinly veiled disguised that allows deep seeded right-wing desires to flourish, which lie beneath awareness of even the most progressive and well meaning people.</p>
